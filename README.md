# Group-3-Naive-Bayes
COMP 3009 - Final Project - Naive Bayes Classification - Weather Classification

# Naive Bayes — Weather Classification (Rain? Yes/No)

A tiny, math-first implementation of a **Naive Bayes** classifier using **Python built-ins only**.  
We classify whether it will **rain** based on four categorical features: `Outlook`, `Temperature`, `Humidity`, and `Windy`.  
An optional check with `scikit-learn`’s `MultinomialNB` is included for comparison.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Show how Bayes’ Theorem + the conditional independence assumption directly produce a working classifier.
- **Scope:** A small, fully transparent demo (14 rows of categorical weather data).
- **Why:** Reinforce the connection between **probability math** and **computational problem-solving**.
